# The hardware I want

Or you. Probably.

## Intent

This is going to be a loose collection of knowledge about current computer hardware. It will cover CPUs, mainboards, memory, mass storage, connectors and hardware protocols. Maybe less, probably more. [Table of contents](#toc)

## Why would you do that?

Because every time I try to buy a new computer I feel like a total n00b. It's like I never knew anything about computer parts. I have to learn it all almost from scratch every time. I hate that. And I hate digging endlessly through Wikipedia, vendor and producer websites, forums (*aargh*) and blogposts when I just want to know what to buy. In fact, not just what to buy but what to want to buy in the first place. I usually have pretty well elaborated ideas about what I am going to do with my computers. So I need to map that ideas to the current state of the art. 

The last time I built a homeserver (FreeBSD, 8 TB ZFS mirror) in early 2017 I went once again through all of this (ha, no, seriously, through a tiny part of it) and decided to write down what I learned in order to not forget it again. Even better, I decided to try to build an entire knowledge base, step by step, evolving with the the trends and changes in hardware and, of course, with my interest.

## Content concept

I want to have a list of features that could be interesting for each type or class of hardware. I want to outline which parts are compatible or needed for each other. And I want to point out which features or protocols or parts are replacing what other things and why. Like oh, look, we now can have SSDs connected via NVMe instead of SATA which allows for higher access speeds even though SATA is still actively developed â€“ but aims for other usecases.

The whole thing will not circle around certain manufactorers or certain products. For CPUs, of course it will. But in all other categories I think it will be more of listing and discussing features. Maybe I will mention a product here and there but that's not the point here.

Last but not least: this is intended for choosing current hardware. Not as a historic archive. As new technologies appear documentation of replaced ones will also get replaced.
