# Chipset

The chipset is basically the piece of hardware that connects the [CPU](../cpus/basic.md) with the computer’s peripherals like storage. Traditionally, the chipset (as in “chips outside of the CPU”) handled also main memory and graphics connection to and from the CPU but these functions have been integrated into the CPU itself nowadays.
